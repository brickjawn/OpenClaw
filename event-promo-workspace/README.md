# Event Promo Workspace

This workspace is used by the custom OpenClaw flavor for event promotion and social marketing.

## Structure

- `skills/` - Custom skills (event-promo, content-drafting, research-summary)
- `system-prompt-louder-than-cancer.md` - Louder Than Cancer agent system prompt (wire via agent config)
- `event-docs/` - Event landing page copy, brand notes
- `assets/` - Event assets (images, media)
- `drafts/` - Content drafts (generated by agent)
- `audit.log` - Human-readable audit trail of public-facing actions (created at runtime)

## Setup

1. Copy `exec-approvals.example.json` to `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json` and adjust paths. See [Event Promo Setup](../docs/use-cases/event-promo-setup.md) for details.
2. Point your agent config to this workspace:

   ```json
   {
     "agents": {
       "list": [{ "id": "main", "default": true, "workspace": "<path-to-this-dir>" }]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add event docs and assets to `event-docs/` and `assets/`.
3. Run `openclaw onboard` and configure WhatsApp + Web UI channels.

## Team sync (OneDrive → agent knowledge base)

When your team edits event docs in shared OneDrive (flyers, survey data, meeting notes), use `scripts/sync_data.sh` to rsync them into a local folder the agent can index:

```bash
# Default: ~/OneDrive/LouderThanCancer → ~/.openclaw/team_sync
./scripts/sync_data.sh

# Custom source/dest
TEAM_SYNC_SOURCE=~/OneDrive/YourEvent TEAM_SYNC_DEST=~/.openclaw/team_sync ./scripts/sync_data.sh
```

Add `team_sync` to `memorySearch.extraPaths` in your config so OpenClaw indexes the synced Markdown. Run the script via cron before your morning digest (e.g. `0 8 * * *`). See [Docker: laptop data layout](/install/docker-laptop-data) for full setup.
