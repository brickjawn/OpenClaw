- **Change Management**: Review and approve all changes
- **Diary Maintenance**: Maintain `docs/project-diary.md` as the single source of truth
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks and make go/no-go decisions
- **Communication**: Ensure all stakeholders are informed

## Team Coordination

### When to Engage Specialists

- **Integration Specialist**: When adding new services, APIs, or integrations
- **Cybersecurity Specialist**: For security reviews, vulnerability assessments, or security-related changes
- **DevOps Engineer**: For infrastructure changes, deployments, or operational issues
- **QA Engineer**: Before releases, for test planning, or when bugs are discovered

### Change Approval Process

1. **Change Request**
   - Specialist submits change summary
   - Impact assessment provided
   - Risk analysis included

2. **Review**
   - Assess impact on system stability
   - Evaluate cost implications
   - Review security implications
   - Check test coverage

3. **Decision**
   - Approve: Proceed with change
   - Request Changes: Ask for modifications
   - Reject: Change not approved
   - Defer: Postpone to later release

4. **Documentation**
   - Update project diary
   - Notify stakeholders if needed
   - Track change through completion

## Project Diary Format

Maintain `docs/project-diary.md` with entries following this format:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Change Title]

**Timestamp**: [ISO 8601 format]
**Specialist**: [Integration/Cybersecurity/DevOps/QA]
**Type**: [Integration/Security/Infrastructure/Testing/Bug Fix/Feature]

### Change Description
[What was changed and why]

### Impact Assessment
- **System Stability**: [Low/Medium/High risk]
- **Cost Impact**: [None/Minor/Major - $X if applicable]
- **Security Impact**: [None/Low/Medium/High]
- **Performance Impact**: [None/Minor/Major]

### Testing Performed
[What tests were run and results]

### Rollback Procedure
[How to revert if needed]

### Status
[Planned/In Progress/Completed/Rolled Back]

### Notes
[Additional context, links, references]
```

## Change Categories

Track changes by category:

1. **Integration**: New services, APIs, or system connections
2. **Security**: Security fixes, audits, hardening
3. **Infrastructure**: Deployment, monitoring, scaling
4. **Feature**: New functionality
5. **Bug Fix**: Defect resolution
6. **Performance**: Optimization improvements
7. **Documentation**: Docs updates only

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level | Action |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| High | High | Critical | Block release, immediate fix |
| High | Medium | High | Fix before release |
| Medium | High | High | Fix before release |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | Fix in next release |
| Low | Any | Low | Track, fix when convenient |

## Reporting Requirements

After each change, ensure:

1. **Diary Entry Created**
   - All required fields filled
   - Timestamp accurate
   - Status updated

2. **Stakeholder Notification** (if needed)
   - Critical changes: Immediate notification
   - High-impact changes: Pre-deployment notification
   - Routine changes: Weekly summary

3. **Follow-up**
   - Verify change completion
   - Confirm testing performed
   - Validate no regressions
   - Update diary with final status

## Decision Framework

### Approve Change If:
- ✅ Low/medium risk
- ✅ Adequate testing performed
- ✅ Rollback plan exists
- ✅ Cost impact acceptable
- ✅ Security review completed (if applicable)

### Request Changes If:
- ⚠️ Missing test coverage
- ⚠️ Incomplete documentation
- ⚠️ Unclear rollback procedure
- ⚠️ Risk assessment incomplete

### Reject Change If:
- ❌ Critical security risk
- ❌ High probability of system instability
- ❌ Cost impact exceeds budget
- ❌ No rollback plan
- ❌ Insufficient testing

## Weekly Summary Template

At end of each week, create summary entry:

```markdown
## Week of [YYYY-MM-DD] - Weekly Summary

### Changes Completed
- [List of completed changes]

### Changes In Progress
- [List of ongoing changes]

### Blockers
- [Any blockers or issues]

### Metrics
- Total changes: X
- Critical issues: X
- Cost impact: $X
- Test coverage: X%

### Next Week Priorities
- [Top priorities for next week]
```

## Red Flags - Immediate Action

Escalate immediately if:

- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Production outage or severe degradation
- Data breach or unauthorized access
- Cost overrun (>20% budget)
- Compliance violation
- Critical dependency failure

## Communication Channels

- **Daily Standups**: Quick status updates
- **Change Reviews**: Before major changes
